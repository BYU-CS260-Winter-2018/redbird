# Redbird Twitter Clone

We are going to build a clone of Twitter over the course of several activities. This are all
documented in the [Wiki](https://github.com/BYU-CS260-Winter-2018/redbird/wiki), day by day.

This application uses the [Vue webpack template](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/), so you
you can do the following if you want to get started with the code here:

```
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve the front end with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# serve the back end
node server.js

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
